    <h2 id="whats-your-question">What’s your question?</h2>

<p>Any evidence-based project relies on the complex, nuanced and deeply important
process of collecting data. This chapter will address considerations around data
collection: from defining your question, through to practical procedures for
dealing with new and found data, to questions of agency, consent and privacy.</p>

<p>Determining the questions that you are trying to answer is the most important
part of a data collection process. Data should always be gathered for a reason:
namely, because you think the answer to your question lies within. You may be
asking simple factual questions (eg. how many students graduate from a school
annually), or questions that are divergent or evaluative (what impact did the
change in curriculum have on students graduating from a school). No matter how
simple or how complex, knowing the question that you are trying to answer is
fundamental.</p>

<p>The next step is to determine where to find information that will most
effectively help you answer your question. There are two main ways of getting
hold of data:</p>

<p>Using existing data – data that has already been released and is publicly
available, like a government census. This group also covers accessing
non-released existing data (like through Freedom of Information requests), or
taking data from existing sources that hasn’t been clearly packaged for research
purposes, like scraping social media sources like Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<p>Collecting new data – gathering data directly from the subject (e.g. doing a
survey of students and teachers in a school) or generating new data, potentially
indirectly (e.g. logging GPS pings of staff cell phones while on specific
missions).</p>

<p>No matter where data come from, try your best to ensure that it is good data.
While there are many things to keep in mind about data quality, the most basic
ones are accuracy, validity and timeliness. These are extremely important
aspects of using data responsibly, but the technical sides to these, for example
on data collection techniques and methodology, fall outside the scope of this
book. Never fear though - there are many sources on this issue that can be
referred to for help.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-new-data">Collecting New Data</h2>

<h3 id="designing-a-data-collection-process">Designing a data collection process</h3>

<p>Designing the data collection process requires asking basic questions about
roles, tools and timing. This section needs to be informed by the risk
assessment conducted during project design (see <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-01-designing-a-project.html#dont-panic-plan-assessing-risks-and-threats"><strong><em>Don’t panic, plan</em></strong></a>.), but
reviewed in detail here for your own project, to carefully consider responsible
data challenges that might surface by the particulars of your data collection.
To begin understanding what data collection methods will responsibly produce the data required by your project, review the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are you collecting and why are you collecting it? How does this relate
to your research question? Have this clear from the beginning of your design
as it helps you throughout the process in making the right choices and
changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who provides the data? Did you get their consent for this specific use?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who will collect the information? Ensure they are appropriate in relation to
the specific identities of your participants (e.g. gender, race, class,
language, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will you collect the data? Establish a clear data collection process –
will data collectors perform data entry in front of responders or after a
conversation with responders? Consider the impact of the data collection
method on the desired conversational outcomes between the data collector and
respondents (e.g. conversations about sensitive topics shouldn’t be
interrupted by the data collection tool; do what you can to remove external
factors that might act as inhibitors for respondents).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How often will the data be collected? Will the same participants be polled
repeatedly? How will frequency interact with other timeframes important to
the community in question? What implications will this have for project
resources and for data validity?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take careful consideration of the tools you will use to perform data
collection. In some cases, paper is a good option if using electronic
devices will create suspicion or risk. But also consider that in some cases,
electronic devices can be password protected and encrypted to protect the
data in ways that paper cannot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will you transfer and store the data? Will the the data collected need
to be centralised? In some cases, decentralised data is appropriate because
the data is mainly operational and serves a short-lived purpose. If you plan
to centralise the data, consider the data flow process from data collection
to centralisation. What is the desired frequency of data centralisation? How
secure is the data centralisation process, and what additional risks may
arise from centralisation?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defining-challenge-areas---an-exercise">Defining challenge areas - an exercise</h3>

<h4 id="step-1-come-up-with-a-detailed-data-collection-plan">Step 1: Come up with a detailed data collection plan</h4>

<p>The questions above can be used to define specific challenge areas for your
project. You might want to create a table to map your steps, adding specific
approaches and challenges that might arise for each. It would be best if done in
a group, on a big sheet of paper. The table below shows examples of what
specific approaches might involve.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/img-02a-00.png" alt="Table 1" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2-brainstorm-risks-and-responses"><strong>Step 2: Brainstorm risks and responses</strong></h3>

<p>When you have identified some of the specifics, talk about some of the common
responsible data challenge areas, such as identification and the social impact
of data collection. Do any of these prompt concerns about the methods that you
are planning to use to collect data? Write down any potential risks that occur
to the team during discussion and note any potential responses that might help
to manage those risks.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/img-02a-01.png" alt="Table 2" /></p>

<h3 id="deciding-what-data-to-collect">Deciding what data to collect</h3>

<h4 id="data-minimums-and-unanticipated-use">Data minimums and unanticipated use</h4>

<p>When deciding what data to collect, consider the minimum amount of data
necessary to reach the project goals in balance with the data you may want to
collect for unanticipated uses. While many development programmes track clearly
defined indicators, there may be an impulse to collect additional data outside
of indicator tracking for operational or research purposes. It is important to
refer back to your risk assessment to inform these decisions.</p>

<h4 id="red-lines---what-not-to-collect-and-what-never-to-collect">Red lines - what not to collect, and what never to collect</h4>

<p>Be clear about the information you will not collect due to relevance,
sensitivities, and risk. Think about unanticipated uses of the data and
potential harm/risk.</p>

<p>In general, when thinking about what data to collect or not to collect, these
are the most important aspects to consider:</p>

<p>Leave it out: Do you really need the names, ages and exact locations? The
rationale for collection should be that it needs to be necessary to achieve your
goals; not just that it would make things easier for you, or save you time.
Often you can reconcile this by collecting less fine-grained data. Sometimes it
means you will decide to refrain from collecting some data completely.</p>

<p>Metadata: This is data describing your data, for example the time a photo has
been taken or the camera that was used. This metadata can reveal a lot of the
information that you were deliberately not collecting, or that you want to
protect. If this is the case, make purging of metadata part of the collection
process from the very beginning, or configure the tools you are using to not
create it in the first place.</p>

<p>Surveillance: While you are collecting data, you are not always alone, and when
someone is passively or actively watching you, they can fill in the gaps.
Depending on your risk assessment, this means you need to take appropriate
measures to conceal your traces in the collection process, alter collection
methods, or not collect the data at all.</p>

<h3 id="live-data-processes">Live Data Processes</h3>

<p>Some projects will use “live data”, which is collected, accessed, reviewed, used
and updated on a continual basis. Examples of such projects include service
delivery projects, or projects that are case-based, in which several different
team members have access to individual’s data and records. These systems can be
especially challenging, as they compress the project data cycle, and force
individual team members to adopt a variety of roles and responsibilities when
relating to potentially sensitive data.</p>

<h4 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and responsibilities</h4>

<p>The first step is to clearly define who should have access to exactly what data
at which point. For example, during the registration process, you may have
intake staff (consider maybe these staff are volunteers or interns) who should
be able to create new registration records but should not have access to
detailed assessment information (which may contain sensitive information) about
the subject. In this example, it could be that only case workers should have
access to detailed assessment information on the subject. If referring a subject
to another agency, that agency may receive a specific sub-set of information on
the subject as to protect sensitive or non-relevant information.</p>

<h4 id="tools">TOOLS:</h4>
<p>Create a Roles-Responsibilities-Functionality Map to help you identify
who should do what and when. Here is an example:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/img-02a-02.png" alt="Role Responsibilities" /></p>

<h4 id="access-to-data-throughout-the-micro-cycle">Access to data throughout the micro-cycle</h4>

<p>In addition to defining roles and permissions during the service delivery
period, you should also define roles and responsibilities throughout the project
lifecycle. Consider who will handle data (and who should not) during data
collection, data management (storing, cleaning, analysing), and internal data
sharing. Do you have data administrators who will oversee the data workflow and
support data access and flow according to the plan you’ve defined?</p>

<h4 id="referencestoragemanagement">Reference/storage/management</h4>

<p>Inevitably, data will be stored on multiple platforms throughout the data
lifecycle. Consider the various tools used for data collection (mobile device,
web form, paper, etc.), data storage (mobile device, laptop, centralized
database, paper, etc.), data cleaning/analysis (Excel spreadsheet, database,
reporting platform, etc.) and ensure there is a safety and security plan for
each of the various platforms used.</p>

<h3 id="common-ways-of-collecting-data">Common ways of collecting data</h3>

<p>There are many methods of collecting data, and each one comes with its own
challenges. When choosing the data collection tools and processes you will use,
think about how it can affect your message and what type of influence it might
have when interacting with the participants.</p>

<p>Web-based surveys: There are a number of popular survey platforms available.
From a functional perspective, it is important that they do what you need them
to do, while not blowing your budget. However, you also need to ensure that they
provide your participants with reasonably secure access (for example at least an
https connection), so they are not transmitting sensitive information over
unencrypted channels.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you are using an external provider, ensure that ideally they have
no access to the data themselves, and cannot be legally compelled to hand it
over without notifying you and allowing you to challenge that order. Refer to
the data management chapter on more legal and practical considerations when
working with external providers.</p>

<p>Mobile phone surveys: Mobile phone surveys are a great way to reach many
participants fast with relatively low cost and a relatively low access barrier.</p>

<p>However, you are critically relying on existing infrastructure that is outside
your control - the mobile phone network. That means, you are relying on
telecommunications companies to follow responsible procedures, as all
information passes through them; not to forget the huge amount of metadata that
they will undoubtedly be in possession of: for example, the location the SMS was
sent from, to whom, and times. They may be legally compelled to hand out either
the metadata, or the data itself, to government authorities.</p>

<p>Consequently, you need to assess whether the phone network operator can be
trusted, when thinking about using mobile phone surveys.</p>

<p>In-person surveys using mobiles or tablets: these surveys follow the same
dynamics as interviews - it may be necessary to establish a safe space for the
participant and a situation of trust where they can give informed consent.</p>

<p>On the positive side, often you have more means of securing the data on devices,
compared to working with paper. However, you need to ensure the devices are
properly secured, in particular by encrypting their storage and establishing
strong passwords. In addition to this, ensure there is a clear and secure way to
process the data from the devices into the management system, and check who else
has access to the data stored on these devices.</p>

<h3 id="quick-checklist-for-tools-security-and-training">Quick checklist for tools, security and training</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Consider the pros and cons of using open source tools for the project (cost,
customisability, independent audit, support)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do some features of the tools you have chosen present security challenges?
If so, can they be managed or closed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will data collectors need to edit their data/information after the fact? If
so, ensure the technology supports the desired level of data editing, and
ideally, that it records any changes made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure selected tools allow for your desired range of data access
permissions: will you need people with various levels of permissions to
interact with specified sets of data? (see section: <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-02-managing-data.html#for-your-eyes-only"><strong><em>For your eyes only</em></strong></a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establish a response plan for potential emergency technical challenges
(phones breaking, no wifi, etc.) and have support ready to go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establish a response plan in case tools are confiscated or lost (eg. being
able to wipe the data remotely)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider using strong encryption software with good end-to-end
implementation to protect data and communications content. Consider built-in
protection features within your selected technology (e.g. device encryption)
and their potential vulnerabilities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure staff have received appropriate training on the established informed
consent process and are aware of ethical considerations around conducting
research on other people</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure staff have received appropriate training on data security for secure
data management with devices that they will be using– password best
practices, anonymised data, device security, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have a process for reporting incidents, to provide care for your staff, as
well as affected participants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this checklist is likely not to be exhaustive, but covers frequently
observed blind spots.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-existing-data">Working with existing data</h2>

<p>Even if your project is not the one that actually collects and creates new data,
there are a number of important issues to consider in terms of dealing with data
responsibly. Once you have identified appropriate data sets that will support
your project activities, there are <strong>three primary areas of responsibility</strong> to
consider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How the data is evaluated for use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How it is managed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How it is presented</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="evaluating-existing-data">Evaluating Existing Data</h2>

<h3 id="understanding-the-context">Understanding the context</h3>

<p>While working with existing data, it is important to remember that data was
collected by someone else for specific purposes and to address certain needs,
which probably don’t match yours. This can lead to <strong>biases and gaps</strong>: since
the producers of this data already had an understanding of what they wanted and
how they wanted it formatted and distributed, they may not have explicitly
included information about the context in which it was produced. Unless you’re
lucky, neither will they highlight steps in the data cycle that were
problematic. It is important to try and gain some insight and understanding of
the context of the data before using it, through considering the following
questions. You might not be able to answer all of them to the extent that you
would like, but taking the time to work out which ones are essentials, and
talking through the others with your team, is important.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is there enough <strong>contextual information</strong> documented by the originator of
the data for you to be able to judge its usability? ie. do you know why it
was collected, when, with whom, under which circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who <strong>published</strong>/licensed the data? Are they the same actor that collected
the data? How much control did they have over the data collection process?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who <strong>funded</strong> the process? If the funder is known for pushing a particular
agenda, bear this in mind when interpreting the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <strong>biases</strong> might the data hold? It may be useful to think of gender,
geographic area, ethnicity, age, income level, internet access, at risk
populations, etc</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <strong>methods</strong> were used to collect the data? Where they appropriate? Are
the limitations of those methods appropriately referenced in the way the
data is presented?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there any <strong>social factors</strong> that should be taken into account when
interpreting the data?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the data <strong>inclusive</strong>? Think of issues like gender, region, etc…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was <strong>active engagement</strong> ensured for the data subjects in the project
design and data collection process? Was there an informed consent process?
Was the data validated by data subjects?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="managing-existing-data">Managing Existing Data</h2>

<p>Data should be usable as well as useful. Data will need to be machine readable
for most types of analysis. Some datasets will not be in analysable formats,
however, and would need to be transformed to be usable. This raises questions of
intellectual property (am I allowed to modify the dataset?) More importantly, it
introduces a transformative process (moving data from one format to another)
that needs to be planned and executed carefully, so as not to lose information
or inadvertently manipulate the data. Make sure to keep versions of the data,
and clearly document your steps so that if you need to you can go back a step
and see where you started from.</p>

<p>Some considerations for the licensing regimes and legal obligations governing
existing data are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Will re-use or re-publication of the data violate any copyrights or other
rights holders?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How should these rights be considered in light of the responsible data
challenges identified in the project risk assessment and in light of the
project objectives?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the licenses or permissions on the data limit the formats in which the
data can be manipulated and reproduced?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does use of the data violate any terms of service?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="who-is-hidden-in-the-data">Who is hidden in the data?</h3>

<p>All data reflects on people. Even when it is de-identified, anonymized or
aggregated so that individuals are not immediately apparent, the possibility to
re-identify individuals is always there, especially when combining that data
with complementary sources of information. This is a phenomenon called the
<a href="http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/05/20/open-data-mosaic-effect/">Mosaic effect</a>.</p>

<h4 id="case-study-i-know-what-you-watched-last-summer">CASE STUDY: “I know what you watched last summer”</h4>

<p>In 2006, the movie streaming company Netflix published 10 million movie rankings
by 500,000 of its customers with the aim of developing a better way of ranking
the movies that it recommends. The data was supposed to be anonymised by
replacing customer names with random numbers and removing personally
identifiable information. However, researchers cross-referenced the Netflix Data
with the public information available on the Internet Movie Database website –
where users publicly enter movie rankings under their own names. By comparing
the two datasets for a small sample of users, it thus became possible to
de-anonymise many of the people and understand their movie choices. Reference:
<a href="http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/12/securitymatters_1213">“Why ‘Anonymous’ Data Sometimes Isn’t”</a></p>

<p>Even without identifying individuals, however, data about “things” or events can
reflect the activities and habits of people and groups when combined with the
right contextual knowledge. A dataset displaying water access points can, for
example be used to infer information about population size, consumption habits
and socio-economic status that could support discriminatory policies or
exacerbate social tensions.</p>

<p>It’s worth spending some time trying to identify types of people reflected by
data, even when they are not readily apparent. Some areas to think about could
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What does this data say about individuals? Who could be left out?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could this data be combined with other datasets to provide more
information?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could this data be used to reveal any sensitive information about people or
groups?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This exercise could be organized as a brainstorming exercise with the project
teams, to try and work out as much as possible about the people behind a found
data set, and then to use those intuitions to consider relevant responsibilities
when using that data.</p>

<p>Collecting anonymised metadata on mobility of groups of persons on the basis of
mobile phones may seem rather innocuous and certainly has helped making
humanitarian aid more efficient in times of crises. However, depending on the
context, this kind of information can have damaging effects on data subjects. As
researcher Linnet Taylor puts it in her study of data science challenge
involving African mobile data: “(…) human mobility is becoming legible in new,
more detailed ways (…) this carries with it the dual risk of rendering certain
groups invisible and of misinterpreting what is visible. Thus this emerging
ability to track movement in real time offers both the possibility of improved
responses to conflict and forced migration, but also unprecedented power to
surveil and control unwanted population movement.”

<h3 id="presenting-existing-data">Presenting existing Data</h3>

<p>When presenting existing data, it is critical to include information about the
data’s provenance and the context in which it was produced. This includes all of
the information uncovered when evaluating and managing the data, but it also
implies being transparent about what is not known about the data. Being explicit
about the data’s contextual unknowns is essential for enabling others to manage
your project’s data responsibly.</p>

<p>An easy way of thinking through the contextual information that might need to be
presented is via the questions listed above, underneath ‘Understanding the
Context”. You might want to present the answers to some of these questions
together with your analysis of the data.</p>

<h2 id="power-to-the-people">Power to the people</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it is easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of collecting
and managing data, and forget that we are working with information about human
beings and their lives. It is crucial to be responsible, open, transparent and
inclusive in the data collection process, creating clear mechanisms for
engagement and feedback, and always keeping in mind who is being described and
who, ultimately, should have the last word.</p>

<h3 id="representation">Representation</h3>

<p>Data is a very powerful tool in telling a narrative about peoples’ lives and
realities. We need to understand how these narratives may impact people’s lives,
and be responsible in the ways we use and present this data. Given that it is
important that data is used in the narrative responsibly, there are two aspects
to consider:</p>

<p>Inclusion: Data can never represent all people and all nuances of a cultural or
social mosaic; no matter how big the sample size used, it is vital to remember
that data is inherently exclusive and rarely, if ever, tells the whole story. If
we ignore the very possible exclusions in data we risk perpetuating social
inequalities. When collecting or finding data, ask yourself: who does the data
leave out? Who is not reflected in this data and what impact might that have on
their lives when using that data for programming, advocacy or policy change?</p>

<p>Accuracy: Data needs to be as accurately reflective as possible of the reality
of the people involved. Otherwise, the narrative that is developed from the data
can be harmful for those people. The accuracy aspect is mainly about ensuring
that the right questions are being asked: there are many elements of data
accuracy that fall into the realm of research methods and techniques of data
collection and so fall outside of the scope of this book. Bear in mind also that
“accuracy” is inherently subjective.</p>

<h2 id="consent">Consent</h2>

<p>The concept of consent is so central, it occupies a full chapter in this book,
and we will only mention it briefly here. One of the first steps involved in
getting data, is making sure that the people who are reflected in that data and
who might be providing that data give permission for you to collect and use the
data. This permission needs to be informed and given willingly, without feeling
as though their other basic rights are at risk if they refuse consent. There are
debates as to whether or not consent is always appropriate or achievable, and
there are different levels of consent. Consent is a keystone to responsible
data, and details on it are given in the relevant chapter.</p>

<h3 id="ownership">Ownership</h3>

<p>Who owns the actual data, and what does that mean for the people involved? Many
detailed laws and regulations exist, governed by legal frameworks around
ownership of data. There is a growing debate on how traditional regulatory
frameworks apply to the new data ecosystems. As these bigger debates settle,
there are a few ethical issues we should think about that are broader than legal
ownership. Ultimately, data belongs to the individual that the data describes,
as they have the right to withhold consent and to remove their data from the
process.</p>

<p>However, there are a few problems with this: given the different types of data
that exist, active data ownership is not always feasible. For instance, census
data is often mandated by national law and an individual cannot opt out of being
counted. Many forms of big data also have very complicated opt-out mechanisms,
if they have any at all. This makes it very difficult for individuals to claim
or retain effective ownership. Some basic questions to ask in this regard are:</p>

<p>Does the individual have control over how their data is used? Do they have power
to stop the data from being used in a certain way? Are they aware of how the
data will be used and is there a way to communicate changes in data use? How are
we accountable to the people reflected in the data? How is this accountability
enforced? There are also important issues to address regarding the power
dynamics that emerge during the use of and collection of data. These are
discussed in greater detail in the chapter The world of data)</p>

<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>

<p>Transparency might seem to be the counterbalance to privacy and security; in
reality the two concepts are perfectly compatible, and effectively two sides of
the same coin, as long as they both work towards empowerment and protection of
people. Transparency calls for disclosure: keeping an open and easily accessible
account of methodology, intent of data use, who will use it and for how long, as
well as how the data, the analyses and the learnings will be shared, and with
whom. There should be a minimum list of data areas that can be safely disclosed.
Specific instances in which this could prove to be important are donor
reporting, monitoring and evaluating programs. Privacy should be granted to
those without power: transparency should be demanded of those with power.</p>

<p>Information is power and as is commonly repeated, with great power comes great
responsibility. It is important to think of transparency in terms of how the
data is being released, and whether all necessary steps to protect individuals
have been taken into account. Is data anonymised and assessed for identification
risks, or is the information for advocacy work where these identities need to be
disclosed? What is the most responsible way to navigate this scenario?
Ultimately, the responsibility of making this choice lies with you.</p>

<h2 id="consent-1">Consent</h2>

<p>Informed consent is the mechanism through which people agree to provide
information for research or data collection projects. Generally, consent has
been understood as something that is given by individuals during direct
interaction with researchers or surveyors, and is composed of three components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>disclosure of research objectives and any risks or negative consequences of
participating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>capacity of individuals to understand the implications of participating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>voluntariness of their participation</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Fully informed consent includes full disclosure of all potential risks and
negative consequences of participation, and might not always be feasible or even
possible. In some instances, it might be difficult for project staff to
anticipate the way in which changing political or cultural contexts will
influence risks for data subjects, and emergencies or pressing needs may in some
cases justify data collection without the consent of data subjects. As a rule,
however, projects which include data collection directly from data subjects
should seek informed consent to the degree that is possible, especially in high
risk contexts. Projects collecting data indirectly (through already existing
data, or data scraping) will struggle to obtain informed consent of data
subjects, but should consider these issues, and whether some form of mediated or
simple consent is appropriate or possible.</p>

<p>Consent can be a highly technical and context-specific matter with many legal
and regulatory implications. For example, consent in the context of academic
research may be different from that in a healthcare context. Also take note that
consent has a particular meaning in a legal context, which can vary across
jurisdictions and across sectors (for a discussion of legal jurisdictions and
obligations, see <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-02-managing-data.html#what-types-of-laws-and-procedures-apply-to-your-data-project"><strong><em>the chapter in Managing Data</em></strong></a>).</p>

<p>This section is a high-level primer on how to think about consent when your
project involves the collection, use and sharing of data. In that sense, it has
a specific focus: it is not about consent to participate in the overall project
to register for welfare benefits or receive medical attention, for example. It
is about consent in relation to the use of the data that is provided as part of
the overall development project.</p>

<p>A few words of caution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This section provides guidelines to help you think through the most common
aspects of consent. It is not a substitute for specific legal advice. In
order to comply with the legal regime applicable to a particular country,
sector, type of data or category of person, you should talk to your legal or
compliance team or specialist advisors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This section proceeds on the assumption that you have already thought
through whether or not certain types of data should be collected at all, and
have satisfied yourself that you are able to safeguard what you do choose to
collect. This section focuses on mechanisms to receive consent once you have
already worked out whether, when and how to collect data.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elements-of-consent">Elements of Consent</h3>

<p>Explaining further the essential elements of consent as mentioned above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Notice or Disclosure: the consent process has to ensure that the participant
must be informed of the nature and purpose of the research, the procedures
to be used, the expected benefits (if any), reasonably foreseeable risks,
possibilities of not participating and procedures for confidentiality and
anonymity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capacity, or Understanding: the information must be easily understood in
that specific context (language, technical jargon) of the participant and
they must be given the opportunity to have any of their questions answered.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voluntariness: the consent to participate must be voluntary, free of any
coercion or inflated promise, and not involve people who have power over the
participants. In the development context, it is difficult - if not
impossible - to remove any power dynamics entirely, however.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally responsible data implies that we also include the following vital
elements of consent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Competence: The participant must be competent to give consent and not
incapacitated due to mental status, disease, or emergency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Form of Consent: In every consent process, the participant must signal
agreement to participation, preferably in writing. In many cases written
consent may not be appropriate and oral or implicit consent may do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Waiver of rights: Consent should not compel the participant to waive any
legal rights or releases from liability for negligence.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-disclose-to-participantsthe-data-subject">What to disclose to participants/the data subject</h3>

<p>Consent has traditionally been regulated as part of the ethical review mechanism
for academic research, and there is no authoritative description of consent
practices for civil society or development project data collection. Fully
informed consent likely requires that projects disclose the following
information to data subjects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The nature and objectives of the project. This may include project history,
partners and funders, as well as the specific objectives of the project and
how those might change over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose for which the data is being collected. How narrow or specific
this needs to be might be dictated by the applicable legal regime, but in
general, consent should be linked to a clearly identifiable purpose rather
than a vague, “omnibus”, open-ended one, however desirable the latter might
be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How the data will be used This includes how the data will be used internally
and publicly, and should also include how the data will and will not be
shared, and any limits to use or the time for which data be stored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What risks the data and its use might pose. This depends on the outcomes of
the risk assessment and can never be exhaustive or authoritative. Disclosure
will need to strike a balance between providing data subjects with the
information they need to make a reasonably informed decision about consent,
and overloading data subjects with information that will have a negative
effect on their engagement, and may itself present risks. For example,
interviewees of the Belfast Project in the early 2000s were irresponsibly
promised that the information they shared would not be accessible until
after their death. They were not appropriately informed of the risk that
this information could be accessed through legal channels. More information: <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/oral-history-where-next-after-the-belfast-project/2013679.article">Where Next After The Belfast Project</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What opportunities data subjects will have to review and influence the data
and its use over time, including opportunities to revoke consent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-disclose-information-to-the-participantdata-subject">How to disclose information to the participant/data subject</h3>

<p>In order for people to be meaningfully informed, disclosure needs to be
communicated in a way that is culturally, technically and socially appropriate.
It also needs to be conscious of political and media landscapes and the fact
that project contexts change over time. This has implications for the types of
information that disclosure includes, as well as the mechanisms for
communication disclosure and whether this takes place in-person, or through
other types of media. Try to think about the following questions to help guide
yourself through these issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Are the methods of disclosure appropriate for the subjects in terms of
language, media, and social contexts? Have you thought about accessible
methods of disclosure (media/literacy/etc.)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there mechanisms built in to understand how project contexts change, and
what implications that has for consent?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will you need to disclose information more than once or on an ongoing basis?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are people seeking the consent adequately trained to do so? For example, can
the staff manage issues of consent and power within interpersonal
relationships, and can they answer common questions that participants might
have?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the processes of providing consent or disclosing information are
mediated by technology, it is important to note the ways in which specific
platforms and media influence the experiences of individuals. Has this been
factored in?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If applicable, how can the quality and consent received reflect on
participatory projects? What does resistance to granting consent say about
project relationships with communities and data participants? Do consent
receipts suggest anything about degrees of engagement or the participatory
nature of a project?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are not including a consent process in your project, explain why?
Does this put subjects at risk?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Participants may change their mind about consent at various times, due to
changing context or circumstances, and there always needs to be a way to
individually revoke their consent. Have you provided for this, and have you
made it easy and accessible so that the method of revocation does not in
itself prove a barrier to exit?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="consent-in-a-digital-world">Consent in a Digital World</h3>

<p>Consent is fairly well understood in a traditional context. In a digital world
that seems to offer infinite potential for information to be shared, adapted,
manipulated and re-used, there is a need to recalibrate our view on the
‘traditional’ concept of consent. It is necessary to include and think about
principled and practical challenges for anyone using digital and mobile tools to
collect, manage and share data for social impact. Equally, if data is collected
offline, or if there is a combination of online and offline data, there may be
issues around merging data, and human data entry errors that may get replicated
when copied onto digital formats, as well as other technical or practical
concerns.</p>

<p>One of the most challenging areas in which to understand the necessity and the
limits of informed consent is in regard to crowdsourced or user-generated data.</p>

<h4 id="consent-for-crowd-sourcing">Consent for Crowd Sourcing:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Map potential risk areas for individuals/users in new and emerging
crowd-sourced data technologies, information from which is used for advocacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Identify, share and develop resources for mitigating these risks between
organisations or initiatives that use crowdsourcing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop Best Practices guidance for organisations using crowdsourcing
technology for human rights research and campaigning.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="developing-a-consent-policy">Developing a consent policy</h3>

<p>To ensure that your project has an appropriate and realistic approach to
consent, it is worth spending some time developing a general consent policy for
your organisation or for a particular project. This will help with understanding
the mechanisms of consent which are appropriate, and ensure that they are
appropriately implemented. A consent policy should address the following
components:</p>

<h4 id="risk-assessment">Risk Assessment:</h4>
<p>The level of consent and protection built-in will depend on the
risk assessment, including an assessment of urgency and data sensitivity. This
may include some sort of threat modelling, or broader sense of assessing risks
that may flow from wrongful or erroneous use or sharing of the data.</p>

<h4 id="disclosure">Disclosure:</h4>
<p>On the basis of the risk assessment, determine how much information you need to disclose to participants or data subjects. Generally this should
include any potential risks or negative consequences that may follow from data
collection and data use. It should also include detailed information about how
data will be used, including time and use limits, future disclosure and
accountability, and sharing, as described below. Generally, there may be a
tension between thorough disclosure and the willingness or ease for individuals
to participate in data collection processes. This balance will need to be struck
through a thoughtful conversation among project team members, ideally with the
input of stakeholders and data subjects.</p>

<p>Time and Use Limits: Setting limits for uses and for how long consent is valid
will need to be balanced by limits broad enough to allow for unanticipated
activities and limited resources; these need to be checked against potential
risk. In particular, you may need to build in triggers or system alerts for when
data gathered for one purpose is likely to be used for another purpose, bearing
in mind that you might need to go back to the original consent giver to renew or
refresh the consent.</p>

<p>Transparency and Accountability: This is about how data will be used and how you
will ensure accountability for that use. How will information on actual use be
shared over time. Will information be shared on specific instances of data use
or data sharing? How often will this be updated? Will this information be posted
on media that is accessible and appropriate for people reflected in the data?
Depending on jurisdiction it may be important to carry out a legal assessment of
applicable data protection regimes, administrative regimes or other restrictive
legislation.</p>

<p>Sharing: How do people who are using the data check whether the use is in-line
with what they consented to? When gathering data, there is often an assumption
that action will be taken upon that data; from the perspective of the
participant, otherwise, why collect it? Other people may make use of this data,
either with the organisation’s consent or without, but it might not always be
shared back with the participant. If people reflected in the data feel as though
such uses are inappropriate or put them at risk, do they have mechanisms through
which to raise these concerns?</p>

<h3 id="implementing-and-maintaining-a-consent-policy">Implementing and maintaining a consent policy</h3>

<p>The political and social contexts in which projects collect and maintain data
rarely remain static. Regularly reviewing and implementing a consent policy over
time is an important measure to ensure that it remains appropriate. It is also
an excellent way to maintain engagement and input from data subjects, to
forecast problems with data validity or support for data collection projects.</p>

<h3 id="is-consent-broken">Is Consent Broken?</h3>

<p>A final word of caution: research increasingly finding indicates that consent
has its limitations. For example, behavioural economics shows how easy it is to
“nudge” people towards giving consent or choosing the riskier of options when
faced when opt-ins or opt-outs.</p>

<p>Legal scholars such as Daniel Solove have talked of the limits of leaving users
to regulate their own privacy and manage consents (in his words, privacy
self-management). In his article, Privacy Self-Management and the Consent
Dilemma, he describes how consent is flawed for many reasons: due to bounded
rationality, people cannot possibly understand what they are consenting to and
what possible uses their data might be put to in the future; they are often not
given an opportunity to withdraw once consent is obtained upfront; they cannot
comprehend the multiplicity of actors with whom their data may be shared; they
lack visibility of who those data handlers are, which means that they cannot
approach them to request that their data is deleted or not shared further.</p>

<p>Further, the impact of aggregation - when small pieces of data about them are
combined with each other to form a more complete picture - cannot be appreciated
upfront at the point of consent, and the societal benefits that accrue from
safeguarding privacy and anonymity should be not be waived through consent. In
Solove’s words,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Privacy self-management takes refuge in consent. It attempts to be neutral
about substance — whether certain forms of collecting, using, or disclosing
personal data are good or bad — and instead focuses on whether people consent to various privacy practices. Consent legitimizes nearly any form of collection, use, or disclosure of personal data. Although privacy self-management is certainly a laudable and necessary component of any regulatory regime, I contend that it is being tasked with doing work beyond its capabilities. Privacy self- management does not provide people with meaningful control over their data.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not suggest that consent is not meaningful. It is, and should be
sought by projects collecting or generating data on people or groups, especially
in contexts of power imbalance. More often than not, consent may be the most
responsible way to implement a project with the knowledge and buy-in of the
intended participants or beneficiaries. Projects should be wary, however, of
relying wholly on consent to legitimize any sort of practice or wide use of data
without regard for the people behind it.</p>
