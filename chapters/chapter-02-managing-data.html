<h3 id="give-your-data-a-safe-space">Give your data a safe space</h3>

<p>Data occupies physical space, even if in our imagination the bits and bytes are
ephemeral. We store data on hard drives, and these drives have a physical
presence, which brings a number of responsibility and privacy implications.</p>

<p>The most obvious issue to address is about data <strong>access</strong>: who can physically
(or digitally) reach that hard drive and copy data from it, or simply take the
drive away with them? Another one is <strong>location</strong>: there are many different
places in which we can store our data. It can be on a laptop, on a USB stick, on
a remote server in some other country, or even distributed throughout different
geographic locations (interestingly, this is probably one of the most common
cases). Location issues also bring with them legal implications, especially if
we don’t know in which country our data is being stored, and which laws govern
digital property there.</p>

<p>This section provides an overview of approaches you can implement to ensure your information is stored, managed and accessed in a responsible, secure and
protected manner. To begin with, it’s worth reviewing the general principles of
data integrity, and how to manage risks surrounding data storage.</p>

<h3 id="data-integrity">Data integrity</h3>

<p>Data integrity is a term used to describe the validity, authenticity and
security of information. It includes aspects of both information security and
information quality, including how information systems and processes for sharing
information are designed. As such, it has some overlap with confidentiality and
availability, but is a useful frame of analysis for considering the interaction
of technical and human influences on data responsibility.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Is the data checked for changes at key points (upload, migration across
servers, migration from data collection devices to the main server)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are changes to the data flagged and are there mechanisms for version
control?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there granular permissions for making changes to the data during
analysis?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the data collection process well-documented? For example, through a
codebook or other document that allows newcomers to the project to make
sense of the data and understand the relationships between data structure,
variables and the data collection process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does the data include contextual information (potentially in metadata) that
is necessary to understand the data?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are data collection notes (eg. on ambiguity, potential duplication,
variations, or more contextual information such as notes made during
personal interviews) provided together with the data in an accessible
format, and the relationship between the two made clear?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are appropriate backup mechanisms in place in case of blackouts or system
failures?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the software used to manage and store the data fully up to date and
licensed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the data interoperable? Can it be accessed by all the people and
platforms that it needs to be? If people who might need to access the data
don’t have technical training, is the data available in common file formats
(such as csv files)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have you future-proofed your data by anticipating changes in institutional
and contextual factors which could make the data difficult to access or use?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="assessing-and-managing-risks">Assessing and managing risks</h3>

<p>A thorough discussion of risk assessments is included in the chapter on project
design. When planning data storage, there are some specific risks and mitigation
strategies that are worth considering.</p>

<p>Some data storage risks and harms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Loss of information (deliberate or accidental)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confiscation of information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data breach</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Legal threats</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Malicious attack</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some mitigation strategies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Speak to other organisations in your community who have conducted data
projects successfully. Ask them about their storage practices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For bonus points, adapt or use standards for benchmarking your information
security procedures, such as ISO 27001 or PCI DSS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Only store the minimal amount of data necessary to complete the task.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>De-identify data by default (though this approach has its limitations, see
the <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-02c-sharing-data.html#anonymising-data"><strong><em>chapter on anonymisation</em></strong></a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encrypt your data at all stages of its collection, usage, transmission and
storage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use secure tools (ideally open source tools which are more transparent) for
communication (for a listing of secure tools, see
<a href="https://www.prismbreak.org/">Prism Break</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delete and destroy data safely when it has become insecure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct regular audits and penetration tests of your security measures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure your organisation is capable of managing and updating the system and
tools on a long-term basis - as technology becomes outdated and easier to
breach</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more information on protecting your information in a physical space, see
Tactical Tech’s <a href="https://securityinabox.org/chapter-2">Security in a Box chapter on this topic</a></p>

<h3 id="separate-storage-for-sensitive-data">Separate storage for sensitive data</h3>

<p>You can store some information separately from the rest. For example, if you
have a database with case files, you can replace the names with codes and create
a spreadsheet with the codes and their resolution to real names. You can then
store this spreadsheet on another, highly-protected computer. This method alone
will in most cases not lead to true anonymisation because the case files are
easily linkable to real persons.</p>

<h4 id="case-study-hacked-and-then-fined">CASE STUDY: Hacked and then fined!</h4>

<p>In 2014, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) imposed a £200,000 fine
on a charity called the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. The organisation’s
website had been hacked by an anti-abortion activist who threatened to publish
the names, addresses, dates of birth and telephone numbers of women using the
service. The ICO determined that considering the sensitivity and risk of the
information, the website did not have adequate security and left a vulnerability
which could be exploited by the attacker. The organisation also breached the
Data Protection Act by keeping data on callers for five years longer than was
necessary. Reference: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/abortion-service-website-hacker-information-commissioner-fine">“Abortion service to appeal against £200,000 fine over
hacked website”</a></p>

<h2 id="dude-wheres-my-data">Dude, where’s my data?</h2>

<p>There are many ways to store data that vary in terms of convenience and
security. How you store your data should be measured against the particular
risks you or your partners may be facing, and your personal priorities: for
example, are you more concerned about data loss, or surveillance? These are
extremely important questions. Perhaps it isn’t so important to you if
authorities have access to your data, but it would be disastrous if the data
were somehow destroyed.</p>

<p>Remember: no method of storing data is 100% safe, so it is essential that you
backup your data, no matter how or where it is stored.</p>

<h3 id="data-storage">Data storage</h3>

<p>There are a few areas to take into consideration as you make decisions on
storage and these could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="physical-location">Physical location:</h4>
    <p>Where should data be stored given the type of data and
the potential vulnerabilities? Within the country you’re working in, or in
another country, and what are the implications of both of these? (eg.
differing legal jurisdictions, local internet regulations, especially with
regards to storing sensitive data)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="digital-location">Digital location:</h4>
    <p>Should data be stored on‐line or off‐line or both? Or is
it open data? (see: <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-02c-sharing-data.html#sharing-data"><strong><em>The Sharing Spectrum</em></strong></a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="ultimate-ownership-of-storage">Ultimate ownership of storage:</h4>
    <p>Consider pros/cons of third party data storage vs local data storage (e.g. do you have local capacity for local data storage; what is the desired uptime; etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="back-ups">Back ups:</h4>
    <p>What level of data back‐ups are required? (you can never back up
too much!) Access: ensure storage method allows for the necessary levels of
access. (see: <a href="#for-you-eyes-only"><strong><em>For Your Eyes Only</em></strong></a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="data-lifecycle">Data lifecycle:</h4>
    <p>What is the data lifecycle and who will manage it until the end of the data’s life? (if it ends!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="saving-data">Saving data:</h4>
    <p>What is the data access / data saving policy, especially for
sensitive data (e.g. if data must be downloaded locally it must be
encrypted, etc.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-storage-options">Pros and cons of storage options</h3>

<p>Some of the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches may be:</p>

<h4 id="locally-on-your-pcs">Locally on your PC(s)</h4>

<p>Advantages: high security if encrypted, fast and always accessible, easier
version control, greater legal clarity over ownership</p>

<p>Disadvantages: lower security if physical theft or confiscation is an issue,
poor backup, bad resiliency in terms of physical emergencies - fires or floods
for example, poor access except for people located near the machines, potential
increase in time spent maintaining the system versus working with a specialist
provider.</p>

<h4 id="on-your-own-network">On your own network</h4>

<p>Advantages: increased resilience, easier sharing and collaboration, better
backup, greater legal clarity</p>

<p>Disadvantages: increased cost, greater skill needed for effective security,
greater reliance on IT support team or third party contractor, potential
exposure still to confiscation</p>

<h4 id="living-in-the-cloud">Living in the cloud</h4>

<p>Advantages: Decreased costs, increased resilience, easier sharing and
collaboration, less downtime, better backup, specialist provider knowledge</p>

<p>Disadvantages: Increased legal uncertainty, no control over physical access,
nearly impossible to vet people with access to the servers, reliant on cloud
company policies which may change</p>

<p>If using cloud hosts, you should ideally identify those who have previous
experience in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Providing secure access and protection for your information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supporting the tools which you wish to use</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Providing good and fast support to their customers - find people who come
recommended from trusted members of your network</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Demonstrable and verifiable commitment to privacy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working with other projects in the humanitarian or human rights field</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working within the legal jurisdiction you need</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protecting physical data: securing your information from theft, damage and
loss</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For many people, information security often makes them think only of digital
data. However, physical data protection is a vital process, as gaining physical
access to data often requires less technical skill than a cyber threat and can
often be an easier strategy for a potential adversary.</p>

<p>Imagine if your office or home were burned down or broken into today - what
would you wish you had thought of in advance? Some things to think about include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4 id="location-of-data">Location of data:</h4>
    <p>The physical security of locations where you store
physical data (such as paper) or physical media (such as laptops, USB
sticks, DVDs, SD Cards, hard-drives). Are they all in the same location, and easy to find and gain access to?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="access-to-sensitive-locations">Access to sensitive locations:</h4>
    <p>Who has access to your office, home and working environment. Especially to areas of highest sensitivity such as server rooms, research desks, consultation rooms, meeting rooms etc. Consider using high-grade locks, CCTV, fences etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="installing-appropriate-fire-safety-controls">Installing appropriate fire safety controls</h4>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="external-staff">External staff:</h4>
    <p>Vetting all staff and contractors such as cleaners or
security guards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="using-an-inventory">Using an inventory:</h4>
    <p>Creating and consistently updating an inventory, to
enable you to be able to identify any loss or theft of data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="building-a-security-incident-registry">Building a security incident registry:</h4>
    <p>This should be filled out if any member of staff physically sees anything suspicious or has an unusual incident occurring with their IT equipment. It allows for monitoring and identification of incident patterns which may otherwise have been missed. For help in identifying suspicious digital incidents, see <a href="http://digitaldefenders.org/digitalfirstaid/">Digital First Aid</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="getting-rid-of-physical-waste">Getting rid of physical waste:</h4>
    <p>Regularly shredding and disposing of any paper waste</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="regularly-changing-security-procedures">Regularly changing security procedures:</h4>
    <p>For example, changing keys, cards, pin codes or other access control mechanisms, particularly following a change of staff.</p>

<h2 id="for-your-eyes-only">For your eyes only…?</h2>

<h3 id="who-can-access-the-data">Who can access the data?</h3>

<p>The person ultimately responsible for the data will need to have both physical
and digital control over the data. Physical access control means having control
over the documents, computers, servers and working areas where data is kept. On
the digital side, check that are you doing all you reasonably can to secure your
data - for example, using strong passwords, encrypted connections, VPN, logging,
two factor authentication etc.</p>

<p>To work out what kinds of permissions and controls others in your team might
need, mapping the types of users and what kind of access they will need is a
useful exercise to undertake early in project planning.</p>

<h4 id="case-study-human-trojans">CASE STUDY: “Human Trojans”</h4>

<p>Many NGOs work on areas that involve high stakes and powerful interests, such as
when it comes to operations in natural resource issues (oil, diamonds, gas).
This often involves collecting information on the ground in countries where
those resources are extracted (sourced from governments, companies, local
people) and then transferring this information to an international office in
another country – often in the Global North – for analysis and reporting. In
this case, it was a company that was adversely affected by one of the NGO’s
reports that started wondering about the source of leaks that caused negative
information about their practices to end up in the NGO reports. It then hired
private intelligence services to specifically find ways to get people working at
the international offices on their payroll. This time, the attempt to infiltrate
the international office to locate the sources was unsuccessful since some of
the targeted employee reported it. The assumed intention of the attempt was to
locate embarrassing information on the NGO to use as leverage, potentially
embarrass their donors, bug their offices and place trojans on their computers.</p>

<p>Lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Human beings are the biggest risk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide access to information on a need-to-know basis only</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even if local operations are secure, complacency in international offices
may increase vulnerability</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Mitigation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Strong vetting of staff is crucial</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct and continuously update a threat assessment, especially when new
data is released</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand your potential adversary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think also about physical access control of offices</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setting-permissions">Setting permissions</h3>

<p>A general security principle is to limit user access to only the minimum amount
of data that they need to be able to do their work effectively - and only have
access for as long as they need it. This ensures the privacy of people who have
had their data stored by your organisation, and also reduces the potential
impact of security incidents such as a data breach or data loss. Put otherwise:
if only very few people have access to the whole database, then there is less
chance of them accidentally deleting all of it.</p>

<p>People should also only have the minimum permissions that they need to do their
job. To do this, you must identify the broad categories of users and what
information they will need to work with. For example, a role such as a remote
medical clinic worker on a short term project might only need to access data
relevant to the area they are travelling in for a few weeks of their deployment.
This means they only need to have access to office files and IT systems which
are relevant to that specific area. However, someone working as a country
researcher tasked with identifying trends across the country might need access
permissions to all of the data in the country for a longer period. Although it
might be less work for you to simply give out the widest possible permissions to
people, to avoid them having to come back to you and have them adjusted. The
easy route is not always the most sensible, and doing so could create a lot more
work for you in the future.</p>

<p>Access permission also includes items like auditing and controlling who can
manipulate, manage and delete data. The person with responsibility for managing
and creating access should schedule regular times to audit the users types and
remove people who no longer need access - for example, temporary workers such as
contractors and interns. Unfortunately this is particularly important for
potentially disgruntled staff such as workers who are fired - a number of
examples exist of people using their old job credentials to illegally access
data at their previous roles.</p>

<p>HUMAN RESOURCES: Bear in mind that if you are introducing people to a new set of
tools or methods for accessing the data, they will likely require ongoing
training sessions and follow up.</p>

<h4 id="case-study-donor-data-danger">CASE STUDY: “Donor Data Danger”</h4>

<p>In a project involving sensitive human rights work, two of the donors involved
insisted collecting a huge amount of data on operations, including names of
people involved and receipts for all activities. Within three months of the
project, however, both of those donors discovered inside threats. In each case,
some of their employees had become disgruntled with their working conditions and
subsequently left the organisations, taking with them a large amount of data –
not only on one project, but all the NGOs and individuals the donor had been
working with and/or had funded. In some instances, this information was even
channelled to the country’s intelligence services directly or indirectly,
exposing a large number of people to high risk (including employees, sources,
beneficiaries, as well as their connections and networks). At the high point of
this crisis, even the regional director of one of those donors said we should
stop passing sensitive information to his employees, as he couldn’t trust those
in the organisation. While it is impossible to prove causality, a considerable
increase in attacks and disruption of those NGOs’ work that had linkages with
those particular donors was reported.</p>

<p>Lessons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be aware and prepared to actively disagree with your stakeholders, even if
they are your funders</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>International actors can be just as much a threat as anybody else – secure
your info from the bottom up, but also all the way up</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t think because an organisation has an international reputation, they
are automatically responsible data holders – in the end, you will be
responsible for your data and the people it reflects!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Encourage a culture of responsible access controls and permissions, not just
within your organisation, but also in organisations you share your data
with.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>

<p>Controlling access effectively means selecting the right choice of methods and
tools which balance the need to keep information secure, and also allowing
effective collaboration in the field. A number of things which need to be
considered in this area include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Types of data that people are collecting, and where they are putting it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tool choice: suitability, usability, support, updates, cost, local vs
network, network vs online access, mobile vs desktop, open source vs
proprietary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Levels of verification for the data: how many people should be looking at
and checking the data?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Speed of internet connections for users accessing data: eg. if users are
collecting data on their mobile devices in the field, the mechanism chosen
for collaboration will need to be able to cope with receiving from such
devices. Depending on phone signal, this may mean collecting and sending
video from remote locations is not possible. This should be thought about
prior to committing to any technical infrastructure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Access points: Collaboration often requires remote access which can
occasionally decrease security, as it opens up a number of less easily
secured access points to a network. As such, tools and methods such as
forcing regular password changes, two factor authentication, network
logging, VPN only access, etc. are important to help mitigate such risks.
(see: <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-03-closing-a-project.html#data-management-resources"><strong><em>Security Resources</em></strong></a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4 id="layered-access">Layered access:</h4>
    <p>Having appropriate access permissions is pivotal to
ensuring that strategies for separating information will work. Note that it
can also be an option to only allow access when several people co-sign, that is, certain data is only accessible when more than one person unlocks it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="but-dont-overdo-it">But don’t overdo it!</h3>

<p>It’s important to make sure that there are rigorous controls on how data is
accessed, but you don’t want to lock it up so tight that you are unable to
access the data when needed. In fact, projects should take active steps to make
sure that the data can be accessed by the right people at the right times. Below
are some concrete steps to take that will ensure data integrity, while also
making sure that it’s available only for the right people at the right time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Backing up your data: regularly back up your files, and test these
procedures on a regular basis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building redundant systems in case of failure: For example, it can happen
that hard drives or essential equipment can completely fail without warning.
Without redundancy like alternate data servers, this can completely disrupt
your operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Building architecture with extra capacity: data collection can be disrupted
when space runs out on storage or collection platforms. You should try to
ensure any system you have can be easily and cheaply expansible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Emergency situations: unexpected interruptions like natural disasters or
internet shut downs can interrupt data collection and transmission. Having a
plan for such occurrences (for example, to shift to satellite links) can
minimize the damage such interruptions may cause.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Targeted disruption: sometimes someone, or something, may target your data
specifically. Ideally, threats such as this will be identified in a risk
assessment, allowing you to build extra capacity into your architecture to
deal with such problems. If hosting on your own, fighting against malicious
attacks (such as Deliberate Denial of Service) can be very expensive.
However, services exist which specialise in absorbing such attacks and using
these is recommended best practice - such as <a href="https://deflect.ca/">Deflect</a>
and the commercial provider <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="legal-considerations">Legal Considerations</h3>

<p>All steps of the data lifecycle are subject to legal requirements, and managing
data securely requires understanding and meeting these requirements adequately.
It’s better to be proactively aware of the legal restrictions on your work, than
to realise after the fact that you’ve been breaking the law and face monetary
fines as a consequence, or that you can’t legally do what you were planning to
do. With the growth of cheap cloud computing (ie. data stored on servers not
owned by your organisation), it is often difficult to know exactly where your
digital data is being held. Popular providers of email and storage such as
Google, Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo, DropBox, GitHub make use of infrastructure
spread across a number of international sites. For example, Google stores data
in the US, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, Chile, Taiwan and Singapore; so, which
country’s laws affect your data? It’s not always easy, but you need to
understand the legal ramifications of where you store your data.</p>

<h2 id="what-types-of-laws-and-procedures-apply-to-your-data-project">What types of laws and procedures apply to your data project?</h2>

<h3 id="jurisdiction">Jurisdiction</h3>

<p>It can be challenging to understand how management of your data is affected by
the laws of the countries in which the data is stored. Some common grounds for
jurisdiction include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The countries where your organization is registered</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The countries where your organization operates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The countries where your data is stored (for cloud storage, this can quickly
become complicated and involve multiple countries)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The countries where your users, participants or subjects are</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes the terms of service or specific policies will determine which law
applies, but often not, and other jurisdictional claims can supercede these. As
a point of departure, it’s worth assuming that all of these jurisdictions apply.
Talk to your technical and legal team to determine which don’t.</p>

<h3 id="data-protection-laws">Data protection laws</h3>

<p>A number of countries have strong data protection laws which place limits on the
types of data which may be collected from individuals. They also often include
specific legal requirements about the methods used to store such data, along
with mandatory reporting and monetary fines for breaches. Individuals about whom
data is stored are often granted a number of rights, such as access to their
information and the right to have their data correction and/or removed.</p>

<p>For an overview of data protection laws in different countries, you can browse <a href="http://www.forrestertools.com/heatmap/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/\#handbook/world-map-section">here</a>.</p>

<p>It might require some careful thinking, but granting people rights to access
data in which they are reflected is crucial, especially for organisations which
collect sensitive data, such as witnesses of human rights violations and
perpetrators.</p>

<h4 id="case-study-data-protection-laws">CASE STUDY: Data protection laws</h4>

<p>Organization X was a human rights organisation in sub-Saharan Africa collecting
and publishing data about human rights abuses by the local government. The
government was embarrassed by this and wanted to stop the organisation from
functioning effectively. Rather than attack the organisation physically, which
they knew would draw international attention, they decided to disrupt its work
by tying them up in nefarious legal cases. For example, the organsation was
severely punished for poorly protecting data, minor health and safety
violations, and accounting malpractices. While the cases were all eventually
thrown out, this caused harmful disruptions to the organisation’s work and
caused them to spend their limited resources on lawyers’ fees. Adhering to
relevant data protection laws may not prevent this kind of legal tactic to be
used against you, especially if the law-makers are targeting you specifically,
but it may limit their techniques.</p>

<h3 id="encryption-technology-laws">Encryption technology laws</h3>

<p>Local laws in a number of countries (such as Sudan, Yemen and Pakistan) place
limits upon the nature of encryption software allowed for the communication and
storage of data. System architecture and tool choice must incorporate these
concerns. Other laws which affect the use of encryption include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>mandatory handing over of encrypted data if requested by government
authorities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mandatory metadata collection by specific industries, eg. telecommunications
(and potentially their subsequent sharing with government authorities)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>laws requiring the weakening of encryption software, such as programmes for
export: some countries (eg. Pakistan) won’t allow the use of programmes
which contain certain levels of encryption. Other countries (like the US)
try to control the distribution of programmes with high-strength
cryptographic controls - this originated from countries not wanting to share
their</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>high-strength cryptographic software with potential adversaries.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>those which require individuals to disclose their passwords (such as the UK) upon government request. NGO registration laws</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An increasing trend in many countries has been the introduction of strong laws
which regulate the presence, funding and/or activities of NGOs in their
countries (for example, Russia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Hungary, Kenya and South
Sudan). Projects initiated in the country must consider these when building data
management infrastructure, and when thinking about different country presences.</p>

<h3 id="jurisdictional-issues">Jurisdictional issues</h3>

<p>Organisations should be aware of laws that would give governments access to
information stored on servers hosted in their countries. For example, Boston
College was forced to give interview information (tapes) to the Police Service
of Northern Ireland after they were subpoenaed.
<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/oral-history-where-next-after-the-belfast-project/2013679.article">Citation</a></p>

<p>It is very difficult to protect digital information from subpoenas (for example, see <a href="http://qz.com/97428/map-how-to-stay-out-of-reach-of-us-extradition-treaties/">this map on US extradition treaties</a>) so it is important to adhere to a minimalist approach to collecting or storing sensitive digital data (or don’t store it all). See section on <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-02a-getting-data.html"><strong><em>Getting Data</em></strong></a>.</p>

<p>Organisations must also be aware of cross-jurisdictional issues in relation to
their data management. It is not unusual for data to be collected in a country
office, transferred to a regional office in another country, then onwards to the
organisation’s headquarters in a third country. Also, some states or regional
groups place strict conditions on where their citizens’ data may be transferred
to - for example, the EU/US Safe Harbour law.</p>

<h3 id="copyright-and-patent">Copyright and Patent</h3>

<p>Copyright and patent issues related to the collection, storage and dissemination
of your data are important laws to consider. Ensuring you have the correct
licensing for your projects and infrastructure can help reduce unexpected
restrictions and costs further into your project. Open licensing such as
Creative Commons options, and open source code such as MIT or BSD licenses
provide tested and off-the-shelf solutions for your data, and open the door to
your peers being able to verify your data, or mixing it with other datasets that
you might not have collected yourself, but which would strengthen your project.
(See section: <a href="/responsible-data-handbook/chapters/chapter-02c-sharing-data.html#publishing-data"><strong><em>Disseminating Data for more information on licensing and
advantages of open licensing</em></strong></a>)</p>

<h3 id="procedures-on-presentation-of-evidence">Procedures on presentation of evidence</h3>

<p>If you intend on using your data in legal cases, you should understand the
requirements used in court for the presenting of evidence. Approaches to digital
data differ significantly in each jurisdiction. However, some standard basic
requirements are that data management systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Allow for an auditable chain of custody (ie. make it possible to know who
has had access to the data at all times)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data. For example, a number of
technical processes (such as hashing and forensic examination) allow a
comparison between original and other versions. Authenticity can be enhanced
through the collection of extra information such as metadata. However this
must be balanced against the extra risk this may pose to collectors - as
often it is not clearly understood by the people involved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure that data is verifiable. The data content itself in many cases should
be verifiable. For example, the massive growth of online video posted to
sites such as Youtube, Vimeo and LiveLeak has driven the development of
methodologies to verify what is shown in the footage - is it showing what it
says it is showing?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
