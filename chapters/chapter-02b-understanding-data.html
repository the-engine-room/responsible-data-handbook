    <h2 id="verifying-38-cleaning-data">Verifying &#38; Cleaning Data</h2>

<p>In a perfect world your data would live in neat boxes, tagged, categorised and
compiled, ready for perusal and analysis. Unfortunately, real life data
collection is often messy, disorganised, uncategorised, jumbled and knotted. We
might, for example, have online surveys with manual input, where the surveyors
enter slightly different definitions of the same thing, making it impossible to
clearly categorise, even if the two data points should clearly belong together.</p>

<p>Or, you might have a situation in which thousands of hand-written surveys are
transcribed by dozens of volunteer college students, some of whom skipped a
letter or a number here and there. The situation becomes even worse when the
project involves collation and aggregation of already existing data sources,
where we don’t have complete knowledge of the methodology, or the data is
provided in badly formatted files.</p>

<h3 id="verifying-data">Verifying Data</h3>

<p>Why is this important in the responsible data perspective? Ensuring the data you
have collected is properly verified is vital. Without verification, the results
cannot be relied upon for decision-making processes, and you risk
misrepresenting or doing harm to the populations you aim to help.</p>

<h4 id="verifying-data-when-youre-close-to-the-source">Verifying data when you’re close to the source</h4>

<p>Integrity: Examine the raw data before doing anything to manipulate it. This
usually includes making a complete backup of the original material, which is
kept separate from any other activities (though it doesn’t prove that the data
has not been manipulated before reaching the storage location). This can be
vital at a later stage for ensuring accuracy, for availability (in case of
accidental deletion) and for responding to accusations of manipulation, for
example in a court situation. A number of methods are available to check that
data has not been manipulated, depending on the method of data collection and
storage. Working with paper, it is often better to work with photocopies or
scanned images, while keeping the originals secure elsewhere.</p>

<p>Similarly, when working with digital data, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Backup an exact copy. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image">using disk imaging software</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify you are using an exact copy of the original. For example, using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_verification">file verification techniques</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more on data integrity, please see the Data Management section of A Home for Healthy Data.</p>

<p>Go back and ask: Reach out to a small sample of the surveyed population for more
in-depth analysis. This requires that in your collection efforts you have the
ability to take and securely store data about the people you survey in order to
contact them again (assuming it is safe to do so). If the initial group was part
of a small qualitative research project, you might scale up through a more
quantitative questionnaire to support your first research.</p>

<p>If you are close to the data collector, it may be possible for you to identify
trends in the data and verify with the data collector. For example, if you see
for a month there were 50 new data submissions, ask the data collector if that
number feels right. Another example, if you see some odd data patterns, you may
be able to trace that data back to the original collector to ask them to explain
how that data came about.</p>

<h4 id="verifying-data-without-the-source">Verifying data without the source</h4>

<p>There are times where you are verifying data where you don’t have access to the
data collector/originator.</p>

<p>Cross-checking: If there are other data available about the same subject, look
at how they compare. Do they reach the same outcome? Depending on the type of
medium you have collected data with (video, photo, paper, etc), there are a
number of techniques for remotely cross-checking the data. For example, with
video footage, this can include:</p>

<p>Examining the extra metadata also captured in the data - such as time, location,
camera type, length, resolution etc. The content itself - such as: Is it
possible to match location features such as roads, terrain etc. seen in the
footage with other images like satellite photos, maps, regular photos? Is it
possible to match identifying information such as building signage with other
information on the area? Is the activity viewed or heard in the data validated
by other information sources such other reports, social media, newspapers etc.
For further techniques, see <a href="http://verificationhandbook.com/">The Verification
Handbook</a> and
the <a href="http://citizenevidence.org/">Citizen Evidence Lab</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cleaning-data">Cleaning Data</h3>

<p>Before moving further, we need to clean the data and prepare it for use by
aggregating, filtering, reconciling and standardising our data and metadata.</p>

<p>Messy data may hide harmful information. If we don’t make sure that we can
clearly name, describe and recognise all the information contained in data sets,
we might make improper assumptions about the risks that that data might pose.
There is something to be said about having a bird’s eye view of an entire data
set that is organised and filtered, as opposed to trying to make sense of
different points that are strewn in different directions. Gaps and assumptions
come to the fore much more clearly after creating some order.</p>

<p>There are some very good sources available for learning what tools are out
there, and how to use them: School of Data, for example, has a number of
tutorials for data cleanup. From the School of Data - Data Cleaning course:
cleaning data can mean a number of different things, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>finding and removing unwanted bits of data in spreadsheets</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>formatting data correctly for the tools you are using</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>dealing with inconsistencies in the data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>structuring it so it can be used effectively for what you want it to do</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>HUMAN RESOURCES: The ability to efficiently manage large data sets is a science,
and people qualified to do so are aptly (albeit not creatively) called data
scientists. This person should have enough spreadsheet savvy to easily merge,
filter and pivot complex data. It might be that your best solution is to hire a
data scientist, or partner with an NGO that has in-house data science expertise.
In any case, your project will benefit from you and your team gaining a firmer
grasp on what procedures exist, and what can (or cannot) be done to clean up
your data set.</p>

<p>Filtering for the greater good Any data set can be described as a list of data
points that are somehow related to one another. Usually these relations are
described through two dimensions, because we visualise them on paper sheets or
computer screens, both having only two axes: height and width. To make it
simpler, imagine a spreadsheet: rows and columns are the two ways, or
dimensions, that we have to relate and connect information. If a row represents
one data point, like information about a high school teacher in Kenya, the
columns will vertically categorize different types of information we have about
all the teachers in the spreadsheet, like place of employment, salary, spoken
languages, course taught, number of times the teacher has been absent in the
last year, etc. Our goal with the data cleanup is to make sure all these
categories show information that is relatable.</p>

<p>Filtering is usually the first step in checking data for consistency. Filtering
creates a menu-like list of data aggregates present in a column, that lets you
choose to visualise only rows with specific content in that column. Tools like
Microsoft Excel, Libre Office Calc, Apple Numbers or Google Sheets all offer
strong filtering functionalities. A first filtering round will already offer an
overview of how much the data set is comparable and where the main need for
cleanup lies. This is a hassle-free, accessible first step for you to understand
more about your data on a very general level, as having a clearer overview is
useful to understanding how to move forward.</p>

<p>For more advanced data cleanup, <a href="http://openrefine.org/">Open Refine</a> offers
powerful ways to combine, compare and reconcile your data. Open Refine lets you
combine and aggregate slightly differing types of data using algorithms that
assist with “fuzzy” comparisons of not-quite-equal information. It also lets you
execute faceted search on your data: a search combining multiple different
filters and data points as facets.</p>

<p>For more in-depth information about data cleanup, visit <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/data-cleaning/">“A gentle introduction
to cleaning data”</a>, as
well as <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/gentle-introduction-exploring-and-understanding-data/">“A gentle introduction to exploring and understanding your
data”</a>.</p>

<h3 id="preparation-describing-your-data">Preparation: describing your data</h3>

<p>A complementary aspect of data cleanup is making sure the information that has
been collected is fully and exhaustively described. Describing information means
documenting and collecting information about information, also known as metadata
(data about data). Typical metadata content types might be “date collected”,
“identifier”, “size of picture”, “format type” etc. When preparing the data set
for analysis, look into all the metadata you might have that describe your data
set and make sure they are documented.</p>

<p>While a great part of the description process will be directly connected to the
data gathering phase, there are additional data points that can be defined
during the preparation phase. Some might be automatic, like pulling metadata
(timestamps, authors, file sizes etc) out of documents. Other might require
manual work, like categorising by theme, type of response, etc - any information
that might be helpful in the analysis phase.</p>

<h3 id="formats-and-standards">Formats and standards</h3>

<p>Data can be described in many ways, and saved in a myriad of different file
formats. It is smart to adopt common standards and file formats for the data, so
that they can be more easily shareable, more resilient (future-proof) and also
comparable with other data sets; or, interoperable. One example of a standard
file format is the comma-separated value format (or .csv) for spreadsheets.
While each spreadsheet software has its own proprietary file format that usually
also provides additional software-specific functionalities, the .csv has the
strength of being shareable across platforms, and a strong open description of
its formatting so that the data lives in a format that can be adapted to other
purposes. Having the data live in a proprietary file format like .xls might mean
that one day the company that owns it stops supporting it, the data set becomes
unusable, and the knowledge is lost.</p>

<h2 id="managing-bias-38-assumptions">Managing Bias &#38; Assumptions</h2>

<h3 id="can-i-trust-what-my-data-set-is-telling-me">Can I trust what my data set is telling me?</h3>

<p>At this phase, you have already collected your data, cleaned it up, described it
and standardised its formats and inputs (if you haven’t, you might want to have
a look at the previous chapter on verifying, cleaning, and preparing your data).
Your data set is begging to be analysed. It might be chock full of interesting
informational clues that you can’t wait to pull out and present. You have a
distinct feeling that the data set you have is going to answer your questions:
more importantly, you are pretty sure it will give you the answers you want.</p>

<p>But wait! Before analyzing your data, this is the right moment to examine <strong>your
assumptions</strong> (and those of others) about the data set. There are numerous
pitfalls when trying to answer questions from data. In this chapter we will
discuss various challenges that may arise when looking into the collected data.
The optimal situation would be that these considerations have already been made
during your design phase, but in real life you are often faced with data already
collected by someone else, leaving you to make sense of it. We aim to cover both
situations here.</p>

<p>This chapter explores the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How do I make sure my data is accurate?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can I make sure I understand what accurate means?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are responsible ways to remove noise from my data?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is causation, and when can I talk about it?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="making-sure-your-data-isnt-biased">Making sure your data isn’t biased</h3>

<p>All data, no matter how it is collected, will contain a certain amount of bias.
It is your task to analyse what those biases might be, to minimise them to the
extent possible, identify the ones that cannot be removed, and make sure that
persistent biases are well known and explicitly flagged throughout the research.
Throughout the data cycle you should keep a keen eye on eliminating as much bias
as possible.</p>

<p>Bias is the tendency of results to favor a certain outcome, due to the implicit
construction or logic of the collection or processing of the data, the way that
the data was collected (setting, sequence of questions) and the way that the
data is analysed. Below we will address some specific points that are useful for
spotting red flags in your data.</p>

<p>Some data is collected using a <strong>sample</strong> of the universe or total population,
on the basis of which we make generalisations about the phenomenon. Being aware
of sampling bias, how it impacts analysis and limits what we can say about the
overall population is important. Was your sample sufficient to allow for certain
types of conclusions? Did it bias your analysis and findings in any way?</p>

<p>In the planning and design phase, bias can be introduced when focus issues and
topics are selected. In the data collection process we can have <strong>response</strong>
bias due to the phrasing or sequence of the questions asked or the setting of
the data collection site. One issue is <strong>cultural bias</strong>, where some answers are
more socially desirable than others, and may skew the result.</p>

<p>You should take special care if you are working with <strong>comparative</strong> data:
differences in collection techniques, or even differing definitions, might
seriously skew your results. If, for instance, you are collecting and comparing
data on sexual abuse between several countries (or even provinces) terms like
assault and rape might have very different definitions in different places.
These differences grow larger as language and culture differ.</p>

<p>Consider testing for <strong>data collection</strong> bias in your results. Often results may
be accidentally or deliberately manipulated by the people collecting the data.
For example, participants may fear losing their benefits if they give negative
answers to the person asking the question. Similarly, the collector may have had
trouble in gaining access to the correct mix of participants. It is possible to
check for this by taking a small sample of the results and re-validating the
data (see the previous section).</p>

<p>Every data set contains <strong>outliers</strong>; data points that are so different from all
the others that it really skews the results. These can be anomalies (one rich
person living in a village) or may just be errors in data entry (entering a few
extra “0s” to someone’s income). Going through the data set carefully and
removing these is part the data analyst’s standard toolkit. However, it is
important to make sure you are only reducing data noise, not changing the data
to fit your expected outcome.</p>

<h4 id="correlation-vs-causation">Correlation vs causation.</h4>
<p>Even if two variables might seem to be related, it
doesn’t mean that one caused the other. The classic example used here is the
correlation between the rise of crime rates and ice cream consumption during
summer months in the US. The two variables are correlated, but neither causes
the other - both are, in fact, linked causally to temperature, but not to each
other.</p>

<h3 id="why-throwing-away-some-of-the-results-might-actually-improve-the-accuracy-of-your-data">Why throwing away some of the results might actually improve the accuracy of your data</h3>

<p>If your data is derived from a sample population, you might have inadvertently
picked one or two individuals that are way off the charts with some of the
parameters, in such a way that you cannot generalise the results. For example,
in measuring the results of an income generation project, you have three women
who have incomes 3 times larger than all 200 others: including these would
significantly change the results of your data and may have been caused by a
simple data entry error.</p>

<p>If the data has been manually entered or been automatically collected, the
outliers might also derive from measurement errors, or a typo.</p>

<p>Removing such data actually makes the remaining data more meaningful (and less
noisy), and provides a more concrete and realistic data set.</p>

<h4 id="compare-with-other-data-and-analysis">Compare with other data and analysis:</h4>
<p>Are there similar, comparable data collection efforts from other countries or groups? There are a number of resources online which can be useful data sources. For example, the <a href="http://www.iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a>.</p>

<h4 id="go-back-and-ask">Go back and ask:</h4>
<p>Reach out to a small sample of the surveyed population for
a more in-depth analysis. This requires that in your collection efforts you have
the ability to take and securely store data on the people you survey in order to
be able to contact them again in future (as long as it is safe to do so). If the
initial group was part of a small qualitative research project, maybe you can
scale up through a more quantitative questionnaire to support your first
research.</p>

<h4 id="connect-with-experts-in-the-field-for-opinion">Connect with experts in the field for opinion:</h4>
<p>Experts working in the field you are doing research on might provide a valuable resource in knowing what your results actually mean, and whether there are gaps or blind spots in your research that you should address before starting the analysis.</p>
