#The Engine Room

##Responsible Data Handbook

This is the source code for the [Engine Room's](https://www.theengineroom.org/) Responsible Data Handbook. It is developed using Jekyll and GH-pages. At the close of development, the handbook will live within the [Responsible Data](https://responsibledata.io) infrastructure. 

The handbook lives at [responsibledata.io/resources/handbook](https://responsibledata.io/resources/handbook).

##Development

Build the site as follows: 

On OSx: 

1. [install rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)

2. `git clone https://github.com/the-engine-room/responsible-data-handbook.git`

3. `cd responsible-data-handbook`

4. `rvm use 2.1.2`

5.  Install dependencies with [bundle](https://rvm.io/integration/bundler): `bundle install`

6.  `jekyll build --safe` to recompile and obtain resulting _site build for production

7. `jekyll serve --w` to run locally with site regenerated on file updates; site will be live at `localhost:4000/responsible-data-handbook/` 
    - `/responsible-data-handbook/` is the `baseurl` as defined in `_config.yml`

*note that the _site/ build  is in .gitignore; see gh-pages below*

## GH-Pages
The site is [live](https://the-engine-room.github.io/responsible-data-handbook/) on gh-pages, sourced by the gh-pages branch, which contains manually populated _site directory generated by `jekyll build --safe`
