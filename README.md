###The Engine Room

##Responsible Data

This is the source code for the Engine Room's Responsible Data Handbook contents. It is developed using Jekyll and GH-pages. 

##Development

Build the site as follows: 

On OSx: 

1. [install rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
2. `git clone https://github.com/the-engine-room/responsible-data-handbook.git`
3. `cd responsible-data-handbook`
4. `rvm use 2.1.2`
5.  Install dependencies with [bundle](https://rvm.io/integration/bundler): `bundle install`
6.  `jekyll build --safe` to recompile and obtain resulting _site build for production
7. `jekyll serve -w` to run locally with site regenerated on file updates

* note that the _site/ build  is in .gitignore; see gh-pages below *

## GH-Pages
The site is [live](https://the-engine-room.github.io/responsible-data-handbook/) on gh-pages, sourced by the gh-pages branch, which contains manually populated _site directory generated by `jekyll build --safe`
