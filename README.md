###The Engine Room

##Responsible Data

This is the source code for the Engine Room's Responsible Data Handbook contents. It is developed using Jekyll and GH-pages. 

##Development

Build the site as follows: 

On OSx: 

    - [install rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
    - `git clone https://github.com/the-engine-room/responsible-data-handbook.git`
    - `cd responsible-data-handbook`
    - `rvm use 2.1.2`
    - `[bundle](https://rvm.io/integration/bundler) install`
    - `jekyll build --safe` to recompile and obtain resulting _site build for production
    - `jekyll serve -w` to run locally with site regenerated on file updates

    ** note that the _site/ build  is in .gitignore; see gh-pages below **

## GH-Pages
The site is [live](https://the-engine-room.github.io/responsible-data-handbook/) on gh-pages, sourced by the gh-pages branch, which contains manually populated _site directory generated by `jekyll build`
