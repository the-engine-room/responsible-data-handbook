##Archiving data

Archiving is a general term for the range of practices and decisions that
support the long-term preservation, use, and accessibility of content with
enduring value. It is not a one-time action, but is instead a process and an
investment that connects directly to your projects' goals.

###Should you archive your data?

You may want to archive your information if it has enduring cultural,
historical, or evidentiary value. Preserving information has the potential to
support the protection of rights, to seek redress, and to support reconciliation or recovery in damaged societies.

###Planning for your data to be archived

Try to identify as early as possible that you want archive, what you want to
archive and where you want to archive. When you are at the closing stage, it may
be overwhelming to solve all arising problems, while having limited time before
you need to move on.

Ideally you will identify the metadata that you need about the information you
are collecting so that you don't need to collect too much and you don't collect
too little.

Try to store data to be archived in popular (=interoperable) formats which are
likely to be used in future (for example, they are used by popular software).
Over the course of a few years formats may go out of use and software systems
become unable to use the data.

Keep in mind that videos can be very large, so you need to make sure that you
have the infrastructure or support in place to accommodate this data (see
potential archive partners below).

###Where do you archive?

If you archive data yourself, you will need to consider the cost, time and
skills that will be required to maintain the archival system. This is not for
the faint of data-heart! See (and learn intimately) the section [***A home for
healthy data***]({{ "/chapters/chapter-02-managing-data.html#a-home-for-healthy-data" | prepend: site.baseurl }} ) and include data storage capacity into your long-term
organisational strategy.

Alternatively, it might be useful to partner directly with an archive that will
help you in the public interest, such as:

-   [The Open Society Archives](http://www.osaarchivum.org/)

-   [Duke University Human Rights Archive](http://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/human-rights/)

-   [Human Rights Web Archive at Columbia University](http://hrwa.cul.columbia.edu/)

-   [University of Texas Libraries' Human Rights Documentation Initiative](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/hrdi)

-   [Archivists without Borders](http://www.arxivers.org/en/asf_internacional.php)
