When you're approaching the end of the project, but still have a little time left on it for some final decisions around archiving and preservation of content. 

##<span id="content-summary">Content summary</span>:

This chapter addresses an oft-forgotten part of the project: the end of it. Too often, the data that is produced during a project is left to one side during the rush of ending a project, but in this section we suggest that deciding what to do with the data after it has served its purpose is an integral part of the project design process. 

To plan for project closure, start by thinking through the types of data you have, and where it all lives. Then you can decide what to do with it; whether that is **disposing of it** (and making sure that that is really the right decision for you, and that the data isn't being used by others) - or working out a responsible way of **archiving** your data. Preserving your information has the potential to be used by others, as well as bringing historical value.

If the data in question is very large, substantial data infrastructure may well need to be in place to support it being archived. If this is too much of a technical burden, then some potential partners for archiving your data are suggested here to make this process a little easier. 

Though it might be easy to forget, what happens to the data at the end of a project can make a huge difference to how the project is referenced, how its legacy lives on (to inform other projects, or not) - and, most crucially, to how the people referenced in the data are treated.
