##Target audience:
Project managers, or those involved in project design. The second section, "Budgeting" is useful for those who are responsible for drawing up budgets, or for donors who are responsible for looking over and approving project budgets. It contains a number of important responsible data issues that should be addressed in a comprehensive project budget. 

##When might this chapter be useful?
Towards the beginning of a project; it contains tips and tools to help you embed responsible data practices into the project from the very beginning. 

##Content summary:

The chapter starts with a series of top tips on how to incorporate **responsible data** practices into a project from the very beginning. It is better to channel energy into comprehensive project planning rather than  letting the potentials of what **could** go wrong lead you to panic. 

A brief overview of how to conduct a threat modelling exercise, a type of risk assessment, is included here, with main discussion points and potential outcomes. A matrix is suggested as a practical tool to help readers actually carry out this exercise including considerations to bear in mind on how the results of this exercise can be used in practice. 

Even with **prevention planning** as discussed above, there are still potential risks that might take place. In case of such incidents, knowing how to discuss them and what to do about them is very important. **Contingency planning** is thus also discussed, with broader organisation-wide guidelines to keep in mind when starting a project.

Often, budget constraints are one of the major reasons that responsible data is pushed to the sidelines. This can be countered with a well-thought out budget from the very beginning. Oft-forgotten items are described in this section, such as the responsible data concerns that come with relying upon external providers for tech support; thinking through hosting and storage in a way that is most appropriate to the data that you are collecting; skills required in a team; back up planning and emergency support, and crucially, project termination. Ending a project well is one of the most often forgotten concerns around a project that might have collected or used a lot of data.This could mean actually archiving the data, making sure that those reflected in the data can have continued access to it, or making sure it is securely taken offline if necessary.
