During our user interviews, we learned that a key part of advocating for responsible data in international development was **internal advocacy**, and one strategy for this which came up frequently was carrying out presentations on responsible data topics.

To this end, weâ€™ve created a set of basic slide decks based on the contents of the book which responsible data practitioners can use to advocate for better data practices within their own organisations. The contents are deliberately fairly basic to allow for the speaker to adapt them to their own specific needs, or use them as-is. The slide decks are available for direct download in PDF, Power Point and Google Slide formats.
