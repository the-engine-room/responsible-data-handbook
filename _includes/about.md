This book is offered as a first attempt to understand what responsible data means in the context of international development programming. We have taken a broad view of development, opting not to be prescriptive about who the perfect **“target audience”** for this effort is within the space. We also anticipate that some of the methods and lessons here may have resonance for related fields and practitioners. This book builds on a number of resources and strategies developed in academia, human rights and advocacy, but aims to focus on international development practitioners.
